# Neighborhood Map Project

**Neighborhood Map** is the final project for "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program". This is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. I added functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Specification
For the project I used:
* React and react-google-maps
* Google Maps API
* Forsquare API
* Flexbox
